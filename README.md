# [C++] Market Console Application

My first project made in C++... except problem solving

### Description
The project is working on '.txt' files as a database. I put some example as '.txt' files but you can delete it without problem and play with program without any problem, '.txt' are made automatically when register a new user/add a new product. 
The app can easily transformed with Win32 GUI or QT4 and a real database as MySql/MySqlLite frameworks into a real app. Just add some buttons/images/forms and voila! Maybe i will when the High School is over.

#### How to use
```
If you are using Code:Blocks just clone and run '.cbp'

In any other IDE clone 'main.cpp' and '.h' files. Start a new project and import main and headers.

Or just copy code and respect files names
```

## General Idea about this project
* I forced myself to use Google as less as possible - i read documentation of windows.h
* I tried to be organized and use good names for function/variable to be easy to read/use
* I had to debug just few times... few mistakes.
* Easier than i expected to build it... thanks to problems solving
